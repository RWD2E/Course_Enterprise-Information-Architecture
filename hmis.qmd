## Electronic Health Records

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital longitudinal collections of patient health information generated by one or more encounters in a healthcare setting. They typically include demographics, clinical notes, medications, laboratory test results, imaging data, and billing information. EHRs provide a central repository for clinical data that supports continuity of care, clinical decision support, and population-level analytics. Scientific research demonstrates that EHR adoption can improve care coordination and reduce medical errors, though challenges such as data quality, interoperability, clinician burden, and privacy protection remain critical areas of focus.

## Common Commercial Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems Used in Ambulatory and Inpatient Care Settings

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent the cornerstone of modern health information management, and a number of large commercial vendors dominate their implementation across ambulatory and inpatient care settings. These systems are designed to support diverse clinical workflows, ranging from outpatient encounters and specialty care documentation to complex inpatient admissions, order entry, and multidisciplinary care coordination.In the United States, several vendors are most widely adopted:

-   Epic Systems: One of the most dominant vendors in both academic medical centers and large health systems. Epic offers an integrated suite of modules covering inpatient and ambulatory care, patient portals, population health, and revenue cycle management. Its extensive interoperability frameworks, such as Care Everywhere, support data exchange across institutions.

-   Oracle Cerner: Historically strong in hospital and health system markets, Cerner (now under Oracle) provides Millennium and other platforms for inpatient documentation, computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and clinical decision support. Cerner is notable for large-scale implementations, including Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs modernization efforts.

-   MEDITECH: Primarily serving community hospitals and regional health systems, MEDITECH offers scalable EHR solutions tailored for inpatient and ambulatory environments. Its newer Expanse platform emphasizes web-based interfaces and interoperability.

-   Allscripts (now Veradigm): Traditionally focused on ambulatory practices and physician groups, Allscripts solutions have also been deployed in smaller hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Its offerings emphasize usability and outpatient workflow support.

Beyond these, systems such as athenahealth, NextGen Healthcare, and eClinicalWorks are widely used in ambulatory practices, particularly among small to mid-sized clinics. These platforms often emphasize cloud-based deployment, practice management, and patient engagement tools.

## Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE)

Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) systems enable clinicians to enter medical orders directly into a digital system rather than relying on handwritten or verbal communication. CPOE reduces transcription errors, enforces standardized order sets, and facilitates integration with clinical decision support tools. Empirical studies have shown CPOE to significantly reduce adverse drug events and streamline care processes. However, system design and workflow integration are crucial, as poorly implemented CPOE systems can introduce new types of errors, such as incorrect selections from drop-down menus.

## Clinical Decision Support Systems

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are computational tools designed to aid healthcare providers in decision-making by presenting evidence-based recommendations, alerts, or predictive insights. CDSS may use rule-based logic, statistical models, or machine learning algorithms to deliver information such as drug interaction alerts, diagnostic suggestions, or prognostic risk scores. Rigorous evaluations show that CDSS can improve adherence to clinical guidelines and reduce preventable errors. Nevertheless, over-alerting, integration with EHRs, and provider trust represent ongoing challenges in their implementation and effectiveness.

## Patient Monitoring Systems

Patient monitoring systems are technological platforms that continuously capture and analyze physiological signals such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiograms. Traditionally confined to intensive care units, these systems have expanded into ambulatory and home-based settings through wearable devices and wireless sensors. Advances in signal processing and real-time analytics allow early detection of deterioration, supporting rapid interventions. Key scientific considerations include accuracy, reliability, alarm fatigue, and data security, particularly as remote monitoring becomes central to telemedicine and chronic disease management.
