# PBL4 - Add AI to Improve Administrative or Clinical Workflow {.unnumbered}

## Case Background

X Rural Health Network (XRHN) serves a geographically dispersed population across rural areas of Missouri and Kansas, who has been facing increasing operational pressures:

-   Rising clinician burnout - Expanding documentation requirements
-   Growing administrative workload
-   Persistent communication gaps across care teams
-   Delayed follow-up on abnormal test results - Patient dissatisfaction with slow response times

Recognizing these challenges, XRHN leadership is exploring whether **AI agents** (autonomous or semi-autonomous digital assistants) could:

-   Reduce administrative burden
-   Improve patient triage
-   Strengthen remote monitoring workflows
-   Detect high-risk patients earlier
-   Enable proactive outreach
-   Support care teams with limited staff

Your team has been tasked with conducting the system’s first structured evaluation of where and how AI agents could improve rural healthcare workflows.

## Problem Statement

Your team must select one of the following rural or remote-care workflows and evaluate where AI agents could augment, automate, or support tasks.

**Candidate Workflow 1: Remote Patient Monitoring Esclation**

-   Issue: RPM data (glucose, BP, weight, SpO₂) generates thousands of alerts per month that nurses cannot manually triage.
-   Potential AI roles: risk stratification agent, summarization agent, trend-detection agent

**Candidate Workflow 2: Rural Telehealth Intake & Visit Preparation**

-   Issue: Patients often join telehealth visits unprepared, with missing vitals or incomplete histories; clinicians spend significant time manually reviewing charts.
-   Potential AI roles: chart summarization, pre-visit questionnaires, technical check agents, patient-prep coaching.

**Candidate Workflow 3: Behavioral Health Crisis Escalation in Remote Areas**

-   Issue: Crisis support is limited; waits for tele-psychiatry can be long; patients may not understand when to seek help.
-   Potential AI roles: risk detection, message triage, safety-monitoring agent, supportive conversational AI agent.

**Candidate Workflow 4: Care Coordination for Rural Chronic Disease Management**

-   Issue: Communication across primary care, specialists, and pharmacies is fragmented; rural patients often lack frequent touchpoints.
-   Potential AI roles: care-plan summarizer, referral-prioritization agent, cross-team communication facilitator.

**Candidate Workflow 5: Patient Education and Self-Management Support for Rural Communities**

-   Issue: Many rural patients lack access to clear, understandable health education. Barriers include: Limited face-to-face time with clinicians, Low digital literacy, Chronic conditions (diabetes, COPD, heart failure) needing continuous self-management, Confusion around medication regimens, Difficulty navigating health information online
-   Potential AI roles:medication explanation agent, self-management coaching agent, appointment prep agent, condition progress check agent, care navigation agent

## Learning Activities

1.  **Identify workflow of interests**. Select a workflow of interest described above and map its current-state workflow, and determine one specific function within the workflow (e.g., interpret, triage, document, escalate, reconcile, remind) where AI agents may provide meaningful benefit.

2.  **Propose AI-agent solution**. Design a conceptual AI agent that supports, augments, or automates the selected function. Your proposal must include:

    -   [*AI agent purpose*]{.underline}: What the agent does and why it improves the workflow.

    -   [*Inputs and outputs*]{.underline}: What data or signals the agent receives (notes, vitals, messages, RPM data, patient questions). What the agent produces (summary, triage score, draft documentation, patient-friendly education content, escalation recommendations).

    -   [*Integration points:*]{.underline} Where the AI agent can be integrated within the current enterprise information architecture (e.g., EHR, REDCap, messaging system, RPM dashboard, telehealth system).

    -   [*Human–AI interaction rules*]{.underline}: When the AI acts autonomously and when human review is required (e.g., flagged uncertainty).

    -   [*Constraints and rural adaptation considerations*]{.underline} : What are some other rural-specfic factors that will need to taken into consideration for effective implementation (e.g. , bandwidth, limited staff availability, digital literacy, offline mode).

3.  **Future-state workflow diagram**. Building on the current-state workflow digram, create a revised, AI-enabled workflow using a flowchart or swimlane format, to show where the AI agent enters the workflow, what tasks it performs, and how it interacts with humans and other systems.

## Expected Deliverables

-   Short report (3-5 pages) summarizing proposed AI-agent solution

-   Architecture Diagram. There are many free or open-source tools for diagramming, such as Lucidchart (<https://www.lucidchart.com/pages>), Diagrams.net (previously draw.io, <https://app.diagrams.net/>), etc. You may use whichever tool you are most comfortable with or that best fits your needs.
