# PBL4 - Architecting Trust: Building Governance and Security in Healthcare Information System {.unnumbered}

## Case Background

Hospital A has just completed a routine HIPAA security audit conducted by an external firm. The final report raises three major red flags:

Access Control Gaps:

Former employees retained active user accounts for up to 60 days after termination.

Clinicians share login credentials for convenience during busy shifts.

There is no consistent role-based access policy across departments.

Inconsistent Data Retention:

Radiology and Lab departments keep historical data indefinitely “for research,” while other departments purge after 7 years.

Backup retention schedules are unclear, and there’s no documented data destruction policy.

Lack of Governance Oversight:

No designated Data Steward or Governance Council.

Privacy and Security Officers operate separately with limited coordination.

The EHR vendor and hospital IT disagree about responsibilities for access logs and audit trails.

The auditors conclude:

“Hospital A has implemented strong technical safeguards but lacks a coherent governance framework to ensure consistent, compliant, and sustainable information management.”


## Problem Statement

You are part of a Governance Task Force assembled by the CIO. Your goal is to design a data governance framework and policy that:

Addresses HIPAA compliance gaps.

Defines clear roles, responsibilities, and decision rights for information governance.

Integrates privacy, legal, and infosec functions within a single governance structure.

Establishes consistent data access and retention policies aligned with regulatory standards and enterprise goals.
