    "text": "Course Description\nEnterprise Information Architecture (EIA) is the strategic blueprint that defines how information is collected, stored, organized, shared, and governed across an entire enterprise. It provides the structures, standards, and policies that ensure information assets are integrated, consistent, secure, and aligned with business goals. This is a graduate-level, problem-based learning (PBL) course that explores how healthcare organizations design, integrate, govern, and evolve their information environments. In this course, students step into the roles of architects, clinicians, compliance officers, and executives as they tackle authentic, evolving case scenarios drawn from modern healthcare challenges. Over the semester, students will analyze fragmented healthcare information systems, design interoperable solutions using HL7 and FHIR, and transform raw clinical data into Common Data Models for research and quality reporting. They will evaluate workflows, model healthcare ecosystems, and craft business value propositions for strategic IT investments. Building on these foundations, the course may also covers a variety of relevant topics on risk and patient safety analysis, governance and data stewardship, change management strategies, and maturity models used to benchmark organizational progress.\nThe emphasis is on hands-on problem solving, system thinking, and real-world applicability. Students will work in collaborative teams to produce artifacts (such as workflow diagrams, system architecture, Business Process Model and Notation, and risk assessments). Every 2-3 weeks, we will work as a team to identify or develop solutions for a real-world problem related to information system or architecture in healthcare. By the end of the course, students will not only understand the frameworks and standards of enterprise information architecture but also be able to communicate the business, clinical, and governance value of information systems in healthcare.",

Most participation will be asynchronous, particularly for group discussions focused on developing solutions to the real-world problems assigned every 2–3 weeks. To track progress, students are strongly encouraged to maintain journals or meeting logs. Project management tools and platforms (e.g., GitHub, Jira) may also be used and will be introduced during the first two weeks of the course. Periodic synchronous meetings may be scheduled as needed to address common topics.\n\n\nPBL Solution Artifacts\nEvery 2–3 weeks, students will be randomly assigned to teams to identify or develop solutions to a real-world problem related to healthcare information systems or architecture. Each team will submit one deliverable artifact per project, with the contributions of all team members clearly documented. Projects will be scheduled to align closely with the course material, and at least five projects will be assigned over the semester. Each student is expected to take the lead in project management for at least one project.\n\n\nFinal Project Design Brief\nAt the end of the semester, students will be assigned an open-ended EIA problem. Each student will propose a potential solution in the form of a Design Brief—a two-page executive summary of their design project. The brief should be written for a multi-disciplinary audience of engineers, policy makers, clinicians, executives, and etc., who may not be as familiar as you are with your clinical and solution space.",

It is a useful representation to place a particular system of interests (SoI) within Use Context, which defines the architectural vision that informs:\na) the core Function of the SoI;\nb) the Boundaries separating the SoI from other supporting systems; and\nc) the Interfaces connecting the SoI to other supporting systems.\nTake a look at the following decompositional view of “a pad of paper” as an example. In this simple 1-level system, the atomic elements are: paper sheets, covers, and spiral.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Decompositional View of a Pad of Paper\n\n\nHere is a more complex decompositional view of a “hospital information system” with multiple level of sub-systems. The atomic elements in this system are: System for Clinical Services, System for Patient Management, Laboratory information system, clinical imaging information system, pharmacy information system, blood bank information system, food&beverage information system, operation theatre information system, sterile supplies information system, and information system for other support services.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

There are two typical representations:\n\nGraphical representation: Object-Process Modeling (OPM). The decompositional view introduced above is a special type of OPM.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Basic Schematic of OPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n\nis the object which is acted upon by the process, which may be created, destroyed, or altered. The Operand that is associated with the delivered value of the system is called Value-Related Operand\n\n\n\nis the pattern of transformation applied to one or more objects. A process relies on at least one object in the pre-process set and transforms at least one object in the pre-process set\n\n\n\nis an object that must be present for that process to occur, but does not change as a result of the occurrence of the processis an object that must be present for that process to occur, but does not change as a result of the occurrence of the process\n\n\n\nChange link: Process changes Operand. For example, “transporting” will change the state of a “person” from “here” to “there”\n\n\n\nAffect link: Process affects Operand. For example, “transporting” will affect the state of a “person”\n\n\n\nCreate link: Process yields or creates Operand. For example, “transporting” will yield or create “entropy”\n\n\n\nConsume link: Process consumes or destroys Operand. For example, “transporting” will consume “energy”\n\n\n\nAgent link: Operand is an agent of Process. For example, “operator” is the agent for “transporting”\n\n\n\nEnabler link: Operand is the enabler of Process. For example, “skakeboard” enables “transporting”\n\n\n\nConditional link: Process occurs if Operand is in certain state. For example, “purchasing” can only occur if you have enough “money”\n\n\n\nInvoke link: Process A invokes Process B directly. For example, “purchasing” ticket will invoke “transporting”\n\n\n\n\nList representation: Design Structure Matrix (DSM), or Decision Structure Matrix or Dependency Structure Matrix, is a “N-squared” matrix representation that is used to map the connections between one element of a system an others. It’s called N-Squared because it is contructed with N rows and N columns, where N is the number of elements. The normal convention, used in this text, is that one reads down the column to the relationship to the row heading, and that things “flow” from column heading to row heading. The types of relationships shown in a DSM can vary, including but not limited to spatial/topological and connectivity relationships.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. A schematic of DSM.\n\n\nIn Figure 4, we present a schematic of the DSM with tasks (A, B, C, …) arranged in temporal order. Marks located below the diagonal line represent forward information transfer to subsequent, dependent tasks, whereas marks above the diagonal denote cyclical loops where information may flow backward to earlier tasks. Such cyclic dependencies often signal the potential for rework, feedback iterations, or coordinated bottlenecks within the process. The “X” marks can be further specified as 1 (strong dependency), 2 (medium dependency), 3 (low dependency)\n\n\nDesign vs. Reverse Engineering\n\nIn (conventional, top down) design, you know the functions (and presumably the goals) and try to create the form to deliver the function\nIn reverse engineering, you know the form, and are trying to infer the function (and presumably eventually the goals)\nIn bottom up design, you build elements and discover what emerges as they come together\nIn design knowledge capture, you record the function along with the design of form\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Form-Function Sequence\n\n\n\n\nTypes of “Vertical” Thinking\nWhen examining complex systems, there are several ways of thinking through them:\n\nTop down: start at the “highest”level and reason down through the system\nBottom up: start at a lower level and reason up\nMiddle out: start at a middle level, and reason toward the top and bottom\nOuter in: start at a the top and bottom, and reason toward the middle",

    "text": "Definitions, Descriptions, and Elements\nComputing refers to the use of electronic devices and algorithms to process, store, and transmit information. At its core, a computer system consists of hardware (physical components), software (instructions and programs), and data (the information being processed). Key elements include input, processing, storage, and output, which together define the flow of information in digital systems.\n\n\nSelecting a New Computer\nSelecting a computer involves evaluating performance factors (CPU speed, RAM capacity, storage type), form factors (desktop, laptop, tablet, server), and intended use cases (general office work, scientific computing, gaming, data analysis). Criteria such as battery life, expandability, operating system compatibility, and budget also shape the decision.\n\n\nHistory of Computers\nThe history of computers can be divided into generations: - First Generation (1940s–1950s): Vacuum tubes, large mainframes, limited reliability. - Second Generation (1950s–1960s): Transistors replaced tubes, smaller and more efficient. - Third Generation (1960s–1970s): Integrated circuits allowed miniaturization. - Fourth Generation (1970s–1980s): Microprocessors enabled personal computers. - Fifth Generation (1980s–present): Parallel processing, networking, and AI-enabled systems.\n\n\nThe Growth of Personal Computers and the Internet\nThe 1980s marked the rise of personal computers (PCs) through companies like Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. The 1990s saw the commercial expansion of the Internet, revolutionizing communication, commerce, and research. The transition from dial-up modems to broadband, and later to wireless networking, underpinned the global digital economy.\nReadings:\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 4.1",

    "text": "Evolution of Health IT: The Early Years\nThe history of Health Information Technology (HIT) in the United States is marked by gradual adoption, policy-driven acceleration, and ongoing challenges in interoperability. Early computing in healthcare began in the 1960s with mainframe-based hospital information systems. By the 1980s, academic centers such as Regenstrief Institute pioneered computerized medical records. The 1990s saw the rise of electronic billing and early electronic health records (EHRs), influenced by managed care and regulatory requirements. After 2000, federal initiatives—culminating in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009—catalyzed widespread adoption, transforming HIT into a central pillar of U.S. healthcare delivery.\nIn the early years (1960s–1980s), HIT primarily supported administrative and financial tasks rather than clinical workflows. The Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS) and the Regenstrief Medical Record System were pioneering platforms. Data storage was limited and proprietary, and clinical systems lacked interoperability. During this period, the focus was proof-of-concept—demonstrating that computers could store, retrieve, and manage patient data.\nReadings:",

    "section": "ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)",
    "text": "ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)\nThe Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, is a conceptual framework that provides a universal set of standards for communication across networks. Its purpose is to enable interoperability among heterogeneous systems—different devices, software, and applications built by different vendors—by breaking down complex networking processes into manageable, standardized layers. This abstraction makes it possible for systems to communicate seamlessly, regardless of differences in design or implementation. Today, although modern networks often rely on the simpler Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, the OSI framework remains the most influential reference for understanding, designing, and teaching communication architectures. At its core, the OSI model is divided into seven abstraction layers, each representing a specific set of functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Layer – Responsible for the raw transmission of bits across a physical medium, such as copper wires, fiber optics, or radio frequencies. It deals with voltages, signal timing, data rates, and hardware specifications.\nData Link Layer – Ensures reliable point-to-point transfer by grouping raw bits into frames, detecting and possibly correcting transmission errors, and managing access to the physical medium. Ethernet is a common example at this layer.\nNetwork Layer – Handles logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding across interconnected networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most prominent protocol here.\nTransport Layer – Provides end-to-end communication, ensuring data integrity, error recovery, sequencing, and flow control. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are common transport protocols.\nSession Layer – Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications. It coordinates ongoing exchanges and manages dialogue control.\nPresentation Layer – Translates data into a format usable by the application layer, ensuring proper syntax, encoding, compression, and encryption. For example, it enables translation between different character sets such as ASCII and Unicode.\nApplication Layer – The closest layer to the end-user, providing network services to applications such as email, file transfer, web browsing, and electronic health record (EHR) access.\n\nCommunication within the OSI model flows in a layered, hierarchical manner. Each layer depends on the functionality of the layer below it while providing enhanced services to the layer above it. Data passed down the stack is encapsulated with headers (and sometimes trailers) appropriate to each layer, while data moving up the stack is decapsulated. Importantly, each layer only communicates directly with its immediate neighbor, but through abstraction, higher layers remain insulated from the complexities of hardware, protocols, and vendor-specific implementations. This separation ensures system independence, scalability, and interoperability.\nThe model not only describes communications at the lowest level—transmitting bits across a medium—but also extends to the highest abstraction of data exchange within distributed applications. Each layer has well-defined semantics, functions, and interfaces, creating a modular system architecture. In practice, communication protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS), and Internet Protocol (IP) can be mapped to specific OSI layers, providing developers and engineers with a logical framework for designing and debugging systems.\nDespite its strengths, the OSI model is primarily a theoretical reference, not an exact blueprint for real-world implementation. Many modern protocols blend functions from multiple layers (e.g., HTTP over TLS blurs application and presentation responsibilities), and in practice, the lines between layers are often blurred to reduce overhead and improve efficiency. For instance, the widely used TCP/IP model condenses the OSI layers into four functional groups: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. Some OSI layers, such as the session and presentation layers, do not have direct counterparts in all implementations.\nNevertheless, the OSI model’s enduring significance lies in its pedagogical and conceptual clarity. It provides an unparalleled “big picture” view of networking, offering students, researchers, and practitioners a structured way to understand the interactions of hardware, protocols, and applications. In healthcare information technology, the model is particularly useful for conceptualizing how data flows from physical medical devices, through hospital networks, and into interoperable electronic health records (EHRs). Its principles help highlight where privacy and security controls must be applied (e.g., encryption at the presentation layer, authentication at the application layer), and how standards like Health Level Seven (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) rely on lower-level protocols to function.\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.1a\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.1b",

    "text": "Basic Health Data Standards\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) systems are not stand-alone platforms; they operate within a complex ecosystem of supporting standards that ensure interoperability, reliability, safety, and usability. These standards complement the core EHR functional models by addressing specific domains such as terminology, imaging, laboratory exchange, security, data provenance, and device integration. Together, they allow EHRs to function as integrated hubs of healthcare data, supporting both clinical care and secondary uses such as research, quality improvement, and public health reporting.\nTerminology and Coding Standards. Standardized vocabularies and classification systems enable consistent recording and interpretation of clinical concepts across systems. Without these, data exchange would be fragmented and prone to semantic errors. Examples include:\n\nSystematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for standardized clinical terminology.\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) for diagnostic coding (maintained by the World Health Organization).\nLogical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) for laboratory test and clinical observation identifiers.\nCurrent Procedural Terminology (CPT) for medical procedures.\nRxNorm, developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, for normalized drug names and codes.\n\nImaging Standards. Medical imaging is central to diagnosis and treatment, and its integration with EHRs requires specialized standards.\n\nDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM): Standard for handling, storing, and transmitting medical images (radiology, cardiology, pathology, etc.), along with associated metadata.\nIHE Radiology Profiles: Build upon DICOM to ensure interoperability across imaging modalities and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\n\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Reporting Standards. Laboratory data is among the most frequently exchanged categories of health information.Laboratory data is among the most frequently exchanged categories of health information.\n\nHL7 Version 2.x Messaging Standard: Defines message structures for lab orders and results, admission-discharge-transfer (ADT) data, and clinical observations.\nIHE Laboratory Profiles: Enhance HL7 messaging to enable plug-and-play interoperability between laboratory information systems (LIS) and EHRs.\nLOINC integration: Ensures that test identifiers are standardized across labs and health systems.\n\nSecurity and Privacy Standards. Safeguarding sensitive health data within EHR systems requires adherence to internationally recognized information security standards.These standards collectively ensure that EHR applications are resistant to cyber threats, compliant with regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the U.S., GDPR in the EU), and trusted by patients and providers alike.\n\nISO/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001: International standard for information security management systems.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53: U.S. security and privacy controls for federal information systems.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS): Protocol ensuring secure data transmission.\nOAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect: Authorization and identity management frameworks increasingly used in modern FHIR-based APIs.\n\nData Provenance and Integrity Standards. As data moves across systems and is reused for research or clinical decisions, tracking its origin and ensuring integrity is essential.\n\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Provenance (PROV) Standard: Provides a framework for representing and exchanging metadata about data origins, authorship, and transformations.\nHL7 FHIR Provenance Resource: Defines how provenance metadata is attached to clinical resources, ensuring accountability and auditability.\n\nTogether, these standards ensure that EHRs are not isolated data silos but dynamic systems capable of supporting patient care, clinical research, public health, and emerging digital health applications. Harmonization and consistent adoption of these standards remain a critical challenge, but they are essential to building a learning health system that is safe, efficient, and patient-centered.\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.5a\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.5b\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.7a\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.7b\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.7c\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 9.7d",

    "text": "Case Background\nIn medical billing, over-coding (or upcoding) refers to using billing codes that exaggerate the complexity or severity of a service to obtain higher reimbursement than warranted (Friedberg et al. 2024). Under-coding (downcoding) is the opposite – assigning codes that undervalue the service, resulting in lost revenue. Some providers also engage in “mid-coding”, consistently choosing moderate-level codes to avoid extremes. A 2024 Health Affairs analysis of hospital discharges in five states (2011–2019) found that upcoding accounted for roughly two-thirds of the observed growth in high-severity (complex) inpatient cases (Crespin, Ginsburg, and Lieberman 2024). Another 2021 report by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) observed a 20% increase (2014–2019) in the proportion of Medicare inpatient stays billed at the highest severity level, despite shorter average lengths of stay – a pattern OIG concluded “reflects upcoding” (Hall Render 2021). In terms under-coding, family and internal medicine outpatient visits are frequently cited – for instance, routine office visits (CPT 99213) are often overused in place of higher-complexity codes (CPT 99214) that many Medicare patients actually qualify for, a pattern that can cost a practice thousands of dollars in lost revenue each month (Revele 2023).\nThe notable implications of these coding issues extend beyond financial ramifications; they can also result in legal consequences, including penalties under the False Claims Act for improper billing practices. Ethical considerations are paramount, as inaccurate coding can undermine the integrity of the healthcare system, erode trust, and jeopardize patient care quality. As healthcare providers increasingly face scrutiny from government and private insurers, addressing the root causes of mis-coding—such as inadequate documentation, lack of training, and evolving coding systems—is essential for maintaining compliance and optimizing reimbursement.",

    "text": "Case Background\nYour team supports dozens of clinical and translational studies every year. Investigators frequently request clinical data extracts from the enterprise EHR or other sensitive resources. Currently, the process is ad hoc: researchers email data requests to a data analyst on your team; the data analyst will collect necessary regulatory documents to the best of their knowledge, and pull the patient-level data, save it in a csv file and send to researchers. This process is ineffiective, error-prone and lacking a consistent review or approval process. An internal audit has identified several governance and compliance gaps:\nLeadership has now mandated the creation of a standardized, compliant, auditable workflow for research data requests—one that leverages REDCap as the central intake, tracking, and data-delivery platform. You are part of the Enterprise Information Architecture (EIA) Task Force assigned to design this workflow.",

Potential AI roles: risk stratification agent, summarization agent, trend-detection agent\nCandidate Workflow 2: Rural Telehealth Intake & Visit Preparation Issue: Patients often join telehealth visits unprepared, with missing vitals or incomplete histories; clinicians spend significant time manually reviewing charts. Potential AI roles: chart summarization, pre-visit questionnaires, technical check agents, patient-prep coaching.\nCandidate Workflow 3: Behavioral Health Crisis Escalation in Remote Areas Issue: Crisis support is limited; waits for tele-psychiatry can be long; patients may not understand when to seek help. Potential AI roles: risk detection, message triage, safety-monitoring agent, supportive conversational AI agent.\nCandidate Workflow 4: Care Coordination for Rural Chronic Disease Management Issue: Communication across primary care, specialists, and pharmacies is fragmented; rural patients often lack frequent touchpoints. Potential AI roles: care-plan summarizer, referral-prioritization agent, cross-team communication facilitator.\nCandidate Workflow 5: Patient Education and Self-Management Support for Rural Communities Issue: Many rural patients lack access to clear, understandable health education. Barriers include: Limited face-to-face time with clinicians, Low digital literacy, Chronic conditions (diabetes, COPD, heart failure) needing continuous self-management, Confusion around medication regimens, Difficulty navigating health information online Potential AI roles:medication explanation agent, self-management coaching agent, appointment prep agent, condition progress check agent, care navigation agent",
