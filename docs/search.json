    "text": "Course Description\nEnterprise Information Architecture (EIA) is the strategic blueprint that defines how information is collected, stored, organized, shared, and governed across an entire enterprise. It provides the structures, standards, and policies that ensure information assets are integrated, consistent, secure, and aligned with business goals. This is a graduate-level, problem-based learning (PBL) course that explores how healthcare organizations design, integrate, govern, and evolve their information environments. In this course, students step into the roles of architects, clinicians, compliance officers, and executives as they tackle authentic, evolving case scenarios drawn from modern healthcare challenges. Over the semester, students will analyze fragmented healthcare information systems, design interoperable solutions using HL7 and FHIR, and transform raw clinical data into Common Data Models for research and quality reporting. They will evaluate workflows, model healthcare ecosystems, and craft business value propositions for strategic IT investments. Building on these foundations, the course may also covers a variety of relevant topics on risk and patient safety analysis, governance and data stewardship, change management strategies, and maturity models used to benchmark organizational progress.\nThe emphasis is on hands-on problem solving, system thinking, and real-world applicability. Students will work in collaborative teams to produce artifacts (such as workflow diagrams, system architecture, Business Process Model and Notation, and risk assessments). Every 2-3 weeks, we will work as a team to identify or develop solutions for a real-world problem related to information system or architecture in healthcare. By the end of the course, students will not only understand the frameworks and standards of enterprise information architecture but also be able to communicate the business, clinical, and governance value of information systems in healthcare.",

Most participation will be asynchronous, particularly for group discussions focused on developing solutions to the real-world problems assigned every 2–3 weeks. To track progress, students are strongly encouraged to maintain journals or meeting logs. Project management tools and platforms (e.g., GitHub, Jira) may also be used and will be introduced during the first two weeks of the course. Periodic synchronous meetings may be scheduled as needed to address common topics.\n\n\nPBL Solution Artifacts\nEvery 2–3 weeks, students will be randomly assigned to teams to identify or develop solutions to a real-world problem related to healthcare information systems or architecture. Each team will submit one deliverable artifact per project, with the contributions of all team members clearly documented. Projects will be scheduled to align closely with the course material, and at least five projects will be assigned over the semester. Each student is expected to take the lead in project management for at least one project.\n\n\nFinal Project Design Brief\nAt the end of the semester, students will be assigned an open-ended EIA problem. Each student will propose a potential solution in the form of a Design Brief—a two-page executive summary of their design project. The brief should be written for a multi-disciplinary audience of engineers, policy makers, clinicians, executives, and etc., who may not be as familiar as you are with your clinical and solution space.",

    "text": "Definitions, Descriptions, and Elements\nComputing refers to the use of electronic devices and algorithms to process, store, and transmit information. At its core, a computer system consists of hardware (physical components), software (instructions and programs), and data (the information being processed). Key elements include input, processing, storage, and output, which together define the flow of information in digital systems.\n\n\nSelecting a New Computer\nSelecting a computer involves evaluating performance factors (CPU speed, RAM capacity, storage type), form factors (desktop, laptop, tablet, server), and intended use cases (general office work, scientific computing, gaming, data analysis). Criteria such as battery life, expandability, operating system compatibility, and budget also shape the decision.\n\n\nHistory of Computers\nThe history of computers can be divided into generations: - First Generation (1940s–1950s): Vacuum tubes, large mainframes, limited reliability. - Second Generation (1950s–1960s): Transistors replaced tubes, smaller and more efficient. - Third Generation (1960s–1970s): Integrated circuits allowed miniaturization. - Fourth Generation (1970s–1980s): Microprocessors enabled personal computers. - Fifth Generation (1980s–present): Parallel processing, networking, and AI-enabled systems.\n\n\nThe Growth of Personal Computers and the Internet\nThe 1980s marked the rise of personal computers (PCs) through companies like Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. The 1990s saw the commercial expansion of the Internet, revolutionizing communication, commerce, and research. The transition from dial-up modems to broadband, and later to wireless networking, underpinned the global digital economy.\nReadings:\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 4.1",

Early computing in healthcare began in the 1960s with mainframe-based hospital information systems. By the 1980s, academic centers such as Regenstrief Institute pioneered computerized medical records. The 1990s saw the rise of electronic billing and early electronic health records (EHRs), influenced by managed care and regulatory requirements. After 2000, federal initiatives—culminating in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009—catalyzed widespread adoption, transforming HIT into a central pillar of U.S. healthcare delivery.\nIn the early years (1960s–1980s), HIT primarily supported administrative and financial tasks rather than clinical workflows. The Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS) and the Regenstrief Medical Record System were pioneering platforms. Data storage was limited and proprietary, and clinical systems lacked interoperability. During this period, the focus was proof-of-concept—demonstrating that computers could store, retrieve, and manage patient data.\nReadings:",

The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) reinforced interoperability mandates and information-blocking prohibitions, pushing HIT towards greater transparency, patient access, and data exchange across systems.\nReadings:\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 5.2",

Hospitals and providers received incentives for implementing certified EHR technology that met defined standards for electronic prescribing, structured data capture, and patient engagement. This act not only drove adoption rates above 80% in hospitals but also introduced the foundation for modern health information exchange (HIE) and quality reporting systems.\nReadings:\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 5.3",

By the 2000s, tools like barcode medication administration (BCMA) and mobile documentation systems reduced errors and enhanced efficiency. Today, nursing informatics integrates predictive analytics, mobile apps, and workflow optimization to improve patient safety and evidence-based care.\nReadings:\n\nHealth IT Curriculum Resources for Educators - 5.5",
