## Objects

-   An object is that which has the potential of stable, unconditional existence for some positive duration of time
-   Can be physical (visible or tangible and stable in form) or informational (anything that can be apprehended intellectually)
-   Objects have states (can be changed by processes)
-   Example: system objects vs. element objects vs. attribute object

## Abstraction

-   Defined as: a) expression of quality apart from the object; b) having only the intrinsic nature rather than the form

-   Abstraction can be used in both function and form

-   Abstraction can be used to characterize and hide non-essential details, allowing simpler representation

-   Example: "cup" can be an abstraction while "a red cup with MU logo" is an object
