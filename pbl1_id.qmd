# PBL1 - Identify Form and Function of a System {.unnumbered}

## Case Background

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are widely used in modern healthcare to improve patient safety and decision-making. Examples include:

-   Drug–drug interaction alerts embedded in EHRs.
-   Predictive risk calculators for sepsis or readmissions.
-   Order sets and care pathways for standardizing treatment.

## Problem Statement

Your team has been asked to select one existing CDSS in healthcare, research its design and purpose, and then decompose it into **forms** and **functions**. The goal is to uncover:

-   **Functions** → the purposeful transformations (e.g., detect risk, notify clinician, recommend action).
-   **Forms** → the physical/logical components that provide those functions (e.g., rules engine, knowledge base, EHR interface, APIs).

## Learning Activities

1.  **Select a CDSS**.
    -   Choose a real-world CDSS (e.g., Epic’s sepsis early warning system, Cerner’s drug–drug interaction checker, or a published AI-based decision support tool).
    -   Gather public information from vendor sites, case studies, and peer-reviewed literature.
2.  **Identify Functions**
    -   What does the CDSS do? (e.g., analyze lab values, compare against thresholds, generate alerts, support clinical decisions, log responses)
3.  **Identify Forms**
    -   How is the CDSS built and arranged? (e.g., knowledge base, inference engine, FHIR APIs, alert UI, terminology services.)
4.  **Architecture Diagram**
    -   Produce a simple architecture diagram showing data flows, functions, and forms. You may follow the OPM approach to generate the diagram, but it is not required.
5.  **Reflect**
    -   Why is distinguishing form and function useful for evaluating CDSS effectiveness and reducing unintended consequences like alert fatigue?

## Expected Deliverables

-   Short report (1-3 pages) summarizing the chose CDSS, its functions and forms

-   Architecture Diagram
